<h1>Movies You Just Can't Ignore</h1>
<h2>My Favourite Action Flicks</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Extraction</h3>
<p>Extraction is a brilliant movie with top notch action sprinkled with a heart felt story</p>

<h3>Raid</h3>
<p>Raid has revolutionized action movies and none have come close to it in terms of raw action.</p>

<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>John Wick needs no introduction, with it's hair raising, keep you on the edge action, you'll only wish that this movie was longer</p>
